# Hi!

I'm Anirudh Kamath, and I'm a basketball analytics nut. I have industry experience at unicorns and established companies alike using serverless data engineering technologies on AWS, like Metaflow, AWS Glue, and PySpark.   

It's one of my dreams to work on data science for a basketball team, especially on a team that consistently defies expectations, like the Thunder.

My main code is at index.py. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to use Pandas or if I had to use the built-in libraries, so I did it both ways. 

Check out [my personal website](http://andykamath.com) to learn more about me!

Look forward to hearing back from you!
